# Chop-n-shop Frontend

## Overview

This week we worked on developing a React app to showcase our grocery shopping assistance features.
We incorporated several interactive components in price comparing, using real grocery store data.


## Site map

/home - Home page   
/profile - Profile of the User   
/grocery-list - Grocery lists page, create new, add items   
/recipe-book - Recipe page, search recipe, save for later   
/price-comparison - Price Comparison page, compares price of an individual item, compares price for the whole grocery list

## Project Setup
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sreya-Mandalika/chop-n-shop-frontend.git
   cd chop-n-shop-frontend
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
   npm install lucide-react
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npm install @radix-ui/react-icons class-variance-authority clsx tailwindcss-animate @shadcn/ui
2. **Run the application:** 
  ```bash
   npm start 

## Development process

**Design Decisions:**
- We designed modular components that were consistent across the pages in our Figma wireframes. Using Figma for this made the collaboration process flow smoother.
- We integrated real life data to make even the prototype useful.

**Technical Choices:**
- We were super happy to apply everything we have learned so far about how to use React as it simplified the process a lot.
- We have very limited CSS use for styling.
